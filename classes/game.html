    <h2>Game Class</h2>
    <p>The <code>Game</code> class in the Pure Chess Library manages the overall game state, player turns, and game settings.</p>
    
    <h3>Properties</h3>
    <h4><code>playerTurn: number</code></h4>
    <p>Represents the current player's turn. It can have two values: <code>0</code> for white player's turn and <code>1</code> for black player's turn.</p>
    
    <h4><code>state: GameState</code></h4>
    <p>An enumeration that represents the current state of the game. It can have values like <code>GameState.NotStarted</code>, <code>GameState.Playing</code>, <code>GameState.Checkmate</code>, and <code>GameState.Stalemate</code>.</p>
    
    <h4><code>moves: Move[]</code></h4>
    <p>An array that holds all the moves made during the game. Each move is an instance of the <code>Move</code> struct.</p>
    
    <h4><code>gamePGN: string</code></h4>
    <p>A string that represents the game in PGN (Portable Game Notation) format. PGN is a standard notation used to record chess games. The format includes information about the moves, result, and other game-related data.</p>
    
    
    <h3>Methods</h3>
    <h4><code>StartNewGame(): void</code></h4>
    <p>Starts a new chess game by initializing the board, setting initial player turns, and resetting the moves history.</p>
    
    <h4><code>StopGame(): void</code></h4>
    <p>Stops the current game, changing its state to <code>GameState.NotStarted</code>. This method is typically used to end a game prematurely or reset the game state for a new game.</p>
    
    <h4><code>RestartGame(): void</code></h4>
    <p>Restarts the current game by resetting the board and player turns. This is useful for restarting a game after it has concluded.</p>
