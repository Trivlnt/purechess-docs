        <h2>Checking and Checkmate</h2>
        <p>In the game of chess, the concepts of checking and checkmate are essential to understanding the strategies and tactics involved. Let's explore what these terms mean:</p>

        <h3>Checking</h3>
        <p>When a player's king is under attack by an opponent's piece, it is said to be in check. The player must make a move to remove the threat to their king. This can be done by capturing the attacking piece, blocking its path, or moving the king to a safe square.</p>

        <h3>Checkmate</h3>
        <p>Checkmate occurs when a player's king is in check, and there is no legal move that the player can make to remove the threat. In other words, the king is under attack, and no move can be made to capture the attacking piece, block its path, or move the king to safety. When a player's king is in checkmate, the game is over, and that player loses.</p>

        <h3>Game Over</h3>
        <p>When a player's king is in checkmate, the game ends immediately, and the opposing player is declared the winner. It's important to strategize and plan your moves carefully to avoid falling into a checkmate position.</p>

        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>Let's consider an example: If the black player moves their queen to a square that puts the white king in check, the white player must respond to remove the threat to their king. If there is no legal move for the white player to make, and the king cannot escape from the threat, then the white player is in checkmate, and the black player wins the game.</p>
